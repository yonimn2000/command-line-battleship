### A command line Battleship game

I was bored one day, so I decided to code this game as a challenge.

The biggest challenges for me during coding:

1.  Randomly positioning ships of different sizes on the board.

2.  Making the computer do smart moves after hitting the player’s ships instead
    of just random moves, meaning that it tries to find the other, un-hit parts
    of the ship around the hit part if it is not destroyed.
