### A command line Battleship game

I was bored one day, so I decided to code this game as a challenge.

The biggest challenges for me during coding were:

1.  To randomly position ships of different sizes on the board.

2.  To make the computer do smart moves after hitting the playerâ€™s ships instead
    of just random moves, meaning that it tries to find the other, un-hit parts
    of the ship around the hit part if it is not destroyed.
